# .nixpacks/nginx.conf.d/custom-uploads.conf

# This is a bit of a long shot, but attempts to ensure the directive is in a server context
# that Nixpacks might be setting up.
# It assumes Nixpacks includes files from this directory into its main server block.

# If your application listens on a specific port defined by Railway (e.g., $PORT),
# Nixpacks usually handles setting up the listen directive.
# We are just adding the client_max_body_size here.

client_max_body_size 64M;

# You could try wrapping it in a location block as well, targeting the whole site:
# location / {
# client_max_body_size 64M;
# # Any other location-specific settings if needed, but usually not for this
# }
